# Introduction
We aim to build a device which can sanitise currency notes by projecting Ultra Violet -C Light (UV-C) at them. Since, UV-C can alter the cell structure of COVID-19 virus, it can act as a promising step in diminishing the spread of the virus. Moreover it can act as a protective measure against any germs, bacteria and viruses.
UV-C Light of specifically 254 nanometre when concentrated on paper notes for a period of 10 minutes have shown to deactivate the virus. 
Reason to choose UV-C? Due to its shorter wavelength and tremendous energy capacity it makes an optimal disinfectant. “Previously, UV-C had also been effective in killing the H1N1 Influenza by causing lesions in its DNA and RNA structure, prohibiting it to replicate, thus effectively killing it”.
